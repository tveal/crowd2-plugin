# Crowd 2 Plugin for Jenkins (crowd2-plugin)

This plugin allows using [Atlassian Crowd](https://www.atlassian.com/software/crowd) or [JIRA](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira) as an authentication and authorization provider for Jenkins (Crowd version 2 and later).

![Notice](docs/img/warning-circle-orange-32.png)

This is a custom mod/fork of the original [Crowd 2 plugin](https://github.com/jenkinsci/crowd2-plugin),
adding a **robotic** creator-and-auth implementation for [Configuration as Code Plugin](https://github.com/jenkinsci/configuration-as-code-plugin).
For more info on the mod, see [docs/robotic-doc.md](docs/robotic-doc.md)

## Usage

1. Add a new generic application in Crowd like described in the [official docs](https://confluence.atlassian.com/crowd/adding-an-application-18579591.html#AddinganApplication-UsingCrowd's'AddApplication'Wizard).
2. In Jenkins navigate to *Manage Jenkins* -> *Manage Plugins* -> *Available*, and search for "*Crowd 2 Integration*". Install this plugin.
3. In Jenkins navigate to *Manage Jenkins* -> *Configure Global Security*. Tick *Enable Security* and select *Crowd 2* as your Security Realm.
4. Insert your Crowd URL and the application credentials you created in step 1.

This plugin works well with [Matrix Authorization Strategy Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/matrix-auth):
You can use Crowd users and groups to define permissions on folder/pipeline/job level.
